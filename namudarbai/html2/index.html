        <h1>Holidays in Lithuania</h1>
        <h4>Holidays</h4>
        <p>
            15 annual public holidays puts <em>Lithuania</em> in the <strong>top ten</strong> of countries that have the most public holidays. Coupled with <del>28 days</del> 20 days of mandatory paid annual leave <i>Lithuanians</i> indeed have time to celebrate. While the centuries-old traditions were hit by various occupations and cultural persecutions of the <b>19th-20th centuries</b>, many have survived, some others are reintroduced or started anew.

        <p>
            Being a <small>Christian country</small> Lithuania has traditional <abbr title="Roman Catholic">RC</abbr> holidays as its most widely celebrated annual events. This includes <mark>Easter</mark>, Christmas and, more uniquely, Christmas Eve. The Day of the Dead lacks the flash of its Mexican version but is nevertheless celebrated in a unique way as the Day of the Souls. The Christian holidays are typically family events and as such are celebrated by <sup>religious</sup> and <sub>non-religious</sub> alike.

            Being Europe's area where <ins>paganism remained strong for the longest time</ins>, some of the traditional <strong><ins>Lithuanian holidays</ins></strong>, while primarily Christian, have surviving pagan influences. There have been attempts to reinstate some pagan or paganism-inspired events that have already died out. <ins><em>Saint John's Eve (JoninÄ—s or Rasos)</em></ins> is among such holidays.

            The BBC filmed much of its recent <cite>War and Peace</cite> drama in Lithuania and neighbouring Latvia. <q>Lithuania has been making films for years,</q> wrote John Gimlette, who travelled on a War and Peace tour for Telegraph Travel.
